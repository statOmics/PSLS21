# Importance of Statistics for empirical research?

- Experimental design
- Data exploration
- Statistical inference

## Concepts on experimental design?

- Defining Population
- Importance of Randomisation
- Sample size
- Control: simultaneous, randomizing, blinding
- Confounding: in which studies do you have a higher risk in confounding?


## Basic Concepts

- Types of variables
- Random variables
- Probability theory
- Statistical modeling
- Estimation
- Why are all our statistics/estimators random variables
- No assumptions: empirical vs assumptions

## Data exploration

- Continuous response and qualitative nominal variable. 
- Two continuous responses 
- Assessing normality
- mean vs median vs geometric mean
- standard devation vs IQR
- pearson correlation vs spearman correlation

# Background 

Researchers want to assess the effect of captopril on blood pressure of 
patients with hypertension. They select 15 hypertension patients at random from 
participants who gave consent to participate in a clinical trial. 
They measure the systolic and diasystolic blood pressure before and after t
reating them with captopril. Hence, we have a randomized complete block (RCB) 
design with patient as block factor, i.e. every patient serves as its own 
control.

In this exercise, we will focus only on the systolic blood pressure. Our goal
is to determine if the captopril treatment was succesful in lowering the
systolic blood pressure.

Load libraries

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

# Data import

```{r}
captopril <- read.table("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/statOmics/PSLS21/data/captopril.txt", 
                        sep=",", 
                        header=TRUE)
```

# Data exploration

**Note that we already explore this dataset in the exercise session on**
**hypothesis testing.**

Before we start delving into the data in order to solve our research hypothesis,
we first explore the data. Our dataset looks like this;

```{r}
head(captopril)
```

We have 15 patients, for which we have measure the systolic 
blood pressure and diastolyic blood pressure, before and after
treatment with the captopril drug.

Note that the dataset is not in the tidy format. We could tidy the data using
the following code.

```{r}
captopril <- captopril %>% 
    gather(type,bp,-id) %>%
    filter(type%in%c("SBPa","SBPb")) %>%
    mutate(id = as.factor(id), type = as.factor(type))
    # we are only interested in the systolic blood pressure
captopril
```

We can visualize the entire dataframe in an informative way 
with boxplots;

```{r}
captopril %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=type,y=bp,fill=type)) + 
    scale_fill_brewer(palette="RdGy") +
    theme_bw() +
    geom_boxplot(outlier.shape=NA) + 
    geom_jitter(width = 0.2) +
    ggtitle("Boxplot of different blood pressure measures") +
    ylab("blood pressure (mmHg)") + 
   stat_summary(fun.y=mean, geom="point", shape=5, size=3, color="black", fill="black")
``` 

# Analysis 1: two-sample t-test

Because we have a pre-test/post-test design we can immediately assess systolic 
blood pressure differences before and after treatment. We already performed this
analysis in the chapter of hypothesis testing.

## Hypotheses

$H0$: On average the systolic blood pressure before and after the captopril 
treatment are equal. 

$H1$: The average systolic blood pressure after the captopril treatment differs 
from the average systolic blood pressure before the treatment

## Assumptions

The paired t-test has 2 assumptions:

1. The observations are independent of each other (in both groups)

2. The data (SBPb and SBPa) must be normally distributed (in both groups)

Additionally, we must check if the variances are similar for both groups.
If so, we can use a t-test with a pooled variance (see theory).
If not, we must rely on the Welch t-test, which can deal with
unequal variances.

The first assumption is met given the experimental design.

Secondly, we assess if the data are normally distributed.

```{r}
captopril %>%
  filter(type == "SBPb") %>%
  ggplot(aes(sample=bp)) +
  geom_qq() +
  geom_qq_line()

captopril %>%
  filter(type == "SBPa") %>%
  ggplot(aes(sample=bp)) +
  geom_qq() +
  geom_qq_line()
```

The QQ-plot shows that the values for the systolic blood pressure can be assumed
to be normally distributed in both groups.

For the third assumption, we must compare the within-group variability of both 
groups. We can do this visually with boxplots.

```{r}
captopril %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=type,y=bp,fill=type)) + 
    scale_fill_brewer(palette="RdGy") +
    theme_bw() +
    geom_boxplot(outlier.shape=NA) + 
    geom_jitter(width = 0.2) +
    ggtitle("Boxplot of different blood pressure measures") +
    ylab("blood pressure (mmHg)") + 
   stat_summary(fun=mean, geom="point", shape=5, size=3, color="black", fill="black")
``` 

We do not observe large difference in the within-group variability of both 
groups. Hence, all assumptions for the paired t-test are valid.

## Hypothesis testing

```{r}
ttest <- t.test(captopril %>% filter(type == "SBPb") %>% pull(bp),
                captopril %>% filter(type == "SBPa") %>% pull(bp),
                paired=TRUE)
ttest
```

Note, that the one sample t-test on the difference produces exactly the same 
result as the paired t-test on the original systolic blood pressure 
measurements. 

There is an extremely significant effect of the captopril treatment on the 
systolic blood pressure of patients with hypertension. 
On average, the blood pressure decreases with 
`r round(unname(ttest$estimate),1)` mmHg after treatment with hypertension 
(95% CI [`r  round(ttest$conf.int,1)`]).

# Analysis 2: Linear regression without blocking (incorrect)

Next, we may try to answer the research question using linear regression.
However, imagine we perform an analysis that uses `type` as the only predictor
variable for blood pressure. Note that such an analsysis does not account for 
the fact that measurements of the same individual are correlated, hence 
violating one of the assumptions for linear regression.

```{r}
lm1 <- lm(bp~type, data=captopril)
plot(lm1)
```

```{r}
summary(lm1)
```

Note, that the point estimate for the captopril effect is exactly the same as
with the paired t-test (estimate = `r round(unname(ttest$estimate),1)`)! 
This is because the design is balanced. The standard error, however, on the 
captopril effect is wrong in this linear regression model, because both between 
and within subject variability in the systolic blood pressure are lumped in the 
error term. Hence, the error term contains the total variability and ignores 
the fact that systolic blood pressure measurements are correlated. 

# Analysis 3: Linear regression without blocking (correct)

Here, we adjust the model formula below to analyse the captopril experiment as a 
randomized complete block design.

```{r}
lm2 <- lm(bp ~ type+id, data=captopril)
plot(lm2)
```

```{r}
summary(lm2)
```

```{r}
library(car)
Anova(lm2, type=3)
```

Note, that the RCB analysis provides exactly the same results as the paired 
t-test (p-value for the captopril effect = `r format(ttest$p.value,digits=4)`). 
If we look at the error term, we notice that it only captures the within patient 
variability in systolic blood pressure measurements. 

**Hence, the RCB analysis is only valid for assessing within block effects.**

Note that we need to use the `Anova` function to obtain type 3 anova results. 
The anova function in R by default returns type I results which assesses each 
term in the model sequentially. For balanced designs this is no problem because 
oth anova results coincide. For unbalanced designs, however, different results 
can be obtained. Note that there is a huge block effect. Showing that there is 
a huge variation in the systolic blood pressures between patients.

## Conclusion

There is an extremely significant effect of the captopril treatment on the 
systolic blood pressure of patients with hypertension. 
On average, the blood pressure decreases with 
`r round(unname(ttest$estimate),1)` mmHg after treatment with hypertension 
(95% CI [`r  round(ttest$conf.int,1)`]).

# Concluding remarks

We have shown that 
  
- The captopril design can be correctly analysed using a paired t-test or 
with a linear model with a blocking factor for patient. 

- In experimental design, we can affect the precision of our estimates by 
    
    1. Increasing the sample size
    2. Blocking to isolate sources of variability from the experiment 

Researchers could further improve the design by using a proper control 
treatment. In the current pre-test/post-test design the blood pressure of 
patients could have dropped due to a placebo effect. So researchers can only 
conclude that there is an extremely significant effect from administering 
captopril to patients with hypertension. They cannot assign the effect to the 
mode of action of the drug. In order to draw causal conclusions they should 
have randomized the patients in two groups: one group that receives captopril 
and another group that receives a placebo. Again blood, pressures 
before and after the treatment should be used to isolate the patient to patient 
variation in the systolic blood pressures from the analysis.
